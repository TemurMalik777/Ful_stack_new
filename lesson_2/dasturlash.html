            Object Oriented Programming is a fundamental concept in Python,
            empowering developers to build modular, maintainable, and scalable
            applications. By understanding the core OOP principles (classes,
            objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction),
            programmers can leverage the full potential of Python OOP
            capabilities to design elegant and efficient solutions to complex
            problems. OOPs is a way of organizing code that uses objects and
            classes to represent real-world entities and their behavior. In
            OOPs, object has attributes thing that has specific data and can
            perform certain actions using methods.

        <h2>What is C?</h2>
        <p>
            C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis
            Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972. It is a very popular
            language, despite being old. The main reason for its popularity is
            because it is a fundamental language in the field of computer
            science. C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to
            write the UNIX operating system.

                    It is one of the most popular programming languages in the
                    world
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you know C, you will have no problem learning other
                    popular programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#,
                    etc, as the syntax is similar
                </li>
                <li>
                    C is very fast, compared to other programming languages,
                    like Java and Python
                </li>
                <li>
                    C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and
                    technologies
